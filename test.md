"Nova Scotia's New industrial Heartland"

## geographic borders ##

PH is an incorporated town --- adjacent to District Municipality of
Inverness and that of Richmond. Much of the industrial/economic activity
reaches across the whole strait area, including the Town of Mulgrave,
the Municipalities of Richmond and Inverness as well as the
Municipalities of the District of Guysborough and Antigonish.

## demographics ##

*   (2011 census)
*   pop. 3,370 (Town of Port Hawkesbury only)
*   the wider commutershed around the Strait Area is about 10,000 people. 
*   Port Hawkesbury lost 7.1% of population since 2001. The Strait Area has been losing population at an even faster rate: 10-20%.
*   Population skews slightly younger than NS.
*   Greater number of lone-parent families than NS (21.6% vs 17.3%)
*   Very low immigration --- 1.4% compared to 5.3% for NS
*   97.4% speak English in the home

## economy ##

Major employers are in heavy industry, mostly sited just outside the
town boundaries. Historically, Port Hawkesbury was based around providing ferry link between Cape Breton and the mainland. Small ferries existed since the
founding of the town and various rail and motor vehicle ferries were based
there in the early 20th century, and provided the main connections.

![Point Tupper, 1878](images/pointtupper1878.jpg )

In 1955, when the Canso Causeway and Canal was built, a huge, ice-free
artificial harbour was inadvertently created. In winter, ice moving into
the Atlantic from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, is blocked by the causeway,
leaving the southern area of the Strait ice-free all year. The strait is
also very deep, allowing very large ships to enter.

A canal splits the Causeway allowing *Seaway-max* ships (those that fit
through the St. Lawrence Seaway) to pass. 

Today, the Strait of Canso Superport has the largest throughput of any port in 
Canada (by weight) after the Port of Vancouver. 

As a result, several large-scale industries set up shop in the area (via
Industrial Estates Ltd., a NS gov't development corporation) due to the
low costs of loading ships, and the lack of restrictions on size.

Though heavy industry (manufacturing, mining and transportation) is the "story" of the strait area, retail is actually the largest employment sector. 

### NuStar Energy ###

*   Point Tupper Industrial Park
*   70-90 jobs
*   30m draft means it can accept the largest ocean-going ships

Mulgrave / Melford, or to the south of the town in
the 55ha Point Tupper Industrial Park (founded 1959) or beyond (mainly
in Richmond County).

![Strait Area Superport](images/straitsuperport.png)

Most of the industrial growth came in the “golden age”: 1966-76.

Family median income is significantly higher than the NS average ---
$89.3K vs $79.8K.

58.1% of residents have post-secondary education, better than NS average
at 53.8%

Land values are lower than NS --- avg. dwelling price is $145K, compared
to $201.9K.

Unemployment is high at 13%. Nova Scotia is 11%, and Halifax is 5%. But
Port Hawkesbury is 2% better than the rest of Cape Breton and Eastern NS
Mainland.

There is talk by the Chamber of Commerce and the PH mayor to position
the strait area as an offshore oil-and-gas industry service hub.
Investments in land and rail would be required to make it happen.
However, the NuStar facility is already doing major business in
transhipment --- moving oil from massive ocean-going ships (many from West
Africa) onto smaller ships that can service smaller-draft ports along
the American Eastern Seaboard.

[Shipping Crude to Point Tupper](http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1225471-weekend-focus-pros-and-cons-of-shipping-alberta-crude-to-point-tupper) 

Another proposal is to run the proposed "Energy East" Pipeline (carrying
Alberta crude) further east than St. John NB, to the much larger port at
the Strait of Canso. The strait‘s port has several advantages over St.
John, including having no restrictions on draft and not having severe
tidal limitations (as does the Bay of Fundy). Upgrades to the CBCNS rail
line (see Transportation below) would allow crude oil to be transloaded
from rail cars to the largest ocean-going ships.

## main st. ##

The Granville Street business district is the historical high street in
town. Unfortunately, like most communities in Nova Scotia, Granville
Street’s function as commercial centre has been supplanted by big box
stores and large institutional buildings sited along Reeves St./Highway
104.

## transportation ##

Port Hawkesbury is well served by car/truck transportation. Just south
of the Canso Causeway, PH is at the junction of several significant NS
highways: 104, 7, 4, 105 and 19. The largest community of the
Strait-Area, Port Hawkesbury is the hub, bringing in people for
business, employment and recreation --- from smaller communities including
Mulgrave across the strait, as well as Port Hastings and Point Tupper
next door. Halifax to Port Hawkesbury Is a 3 hour’s drive. Sydney to
Port Hawkesbury is 2 hours.

There is no short-haul public transit in the Strait-Area --- the Strait
Area Transit Co-Op has operated in the past, but Port Hawkesbury has
committed no funding or resources to help operate it, and it has not
succeeded. It is not currently in operation.

Maritime Bus runs regular daily inter-city service to the community from
Halifax and Sydney and points in-between.

Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia (CBCNS) Railway runs through the
town en route between Truro and Sydney. The line from PH to Truro is
healthy --- because of its connection with mainland Canada and Point
Tupper’s heavy industries. Crude oil is transhipped from rail cars to
the NuStar facility. There is some concern about the potential of
railcars carrying crude passing through town --- especially after the Lac
Megantic disaster. The rail line between PH and Sydney may be abandoned
for a lack of traffic. No passenger rail service exists anywhere in the
Strait Area.

Active transportation --- no facilities exist. Oddly, Port Hawkesbury is
one of 2 NS municipalities where a bicycle license is required to cycle
within the town lines. It is unclear what it’s purpose is (it is not
tied to any educational programming, or bylaws unique to the town. It is
unlikely this is enforced.

Railroad tracks divide the waterfront from downtown.

Port Hawksbury's raison d'être is really to facilitate transportation
between mainland NS and Cape Breton. The town is the site of a railway
ferry that connected CB and NS rail lines. When the causeway was built
1955, the ferries were no longer needed, and it was thought that Port
Hawkesbury would lose a big source of employment. However, ferry
employment (and various secondary employment) was replaced with
servicing heavy industry and the newly created deepwater port.

![opening of the causeway 13 Aug, 1955](images/launchofthecauseway.jpg)

Transport by boat was still the main way around until the 1880s when the Intercolonial Rail (ICR) arrived at Mulgrave. 

## water ##

Port Hawkesbury was once called *Ship Harbour* --- in fact the town's
harbour is still called by that name (there is another village called
Ship Harbour within the Halifax RM on the eastern shore). PH was a
ship-building centre in the late 19^th^ century, hence the name.

Municipal freshwater supply comes from the Landry Lake Watershed, which
is just to the SE of town. Wastewater is treated in a central plant for
the town and released into the harbour.

Downtown has Embree's Pond which is a freshwater feature just outside
downtown. A park (?) protects the pond from development.

Unfortunately, despite its age, few important heritage sites exist in Port Hawkesbury.

Captain James Embree House (1880) is now a B&B.

![Ferry Service Discontinued](images/ferrydiscontinued.jpg)

100 bagpipers were hired to play the old chestnut "Road to the Isles" to celebrate the opening of the Canso Causeway in 1955, which would surely change the island's character forever. They were to march across from one end to the other (2.1km). One piper, Roderick MacPherson, known as "Big Rod the Piper", decided to back out at the last minute, saying "he could not celebrate a bridge that would only bring tourists driving fast cars and take Islanders themselves away." When the organizers begged him to play, he agreed to march with the other 99 but not to play.

[Song of the Causeway - source material](http://eighteenbridges.com/ProsePointRoot/story/song-causeway)

It was written that a minister once in a prayer said,".... and we thank thee, Lord for the Gut of Canso that separates us from the evil on the other side". 

The harbour would freeze in the wintertime allowing for horseraces on the as well as ice skating --- and residents would take the short cut between Port Hawkesbury and Port Hastings across the ice.
