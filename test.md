# executive summary

The Trans Canada Trail (TCT) seeks to improve signage throughout its 24,000km network prior to the 25th anniversary of the organization in 2017. The TCT hired Form:Media, a consultancy based in Halifax NS, to develop a strategic signage plan, and to that end we reviewed existing signage practices and designs, the state of signs and structures on the trail, and looked for guidance from the practices of other long distance trails around the world (e.g. the Camino de Santiago, the Appalachian Trail).

The majority of the Trans Canada Trail's project goals are to do with branding, with a some wayfinding. We focused on the TCT brand and how signage interacts with that brand, considering how trail users enjoy the trail, and the organizational complexity of the Trans Canada Trail's relationship with provincial trail organizations, government agencies, municipalities and volunteer trail management groups. 

Form:Media identified 6 key strategies to guide the the Trans Canada Trail forward:

- Develop the mythology of the Trans Canada Trail.
- Install fewer signs, in better locations, with more focused messaging.
- Turn pavilions into checkpoints, “stations of arrival”.
- Divide the trail into named segments, and define priority destinations.
- Provide comprehensive pre-visit information. 
- Focus interpretation on travel and things users can experience on the trail.

From these strategies, we propose 7 tactics—things the Trans Canada Trail can implement over the next 2 years to bring the strategies into play:

- hire a strategic signage manager
- modify the TCT logo (preserving the symbology) to improve its visibility on the trail
- integrate digital tools to improve the user experience
- RFP for a national interpretive plan
- draft sign designs, start a signage pilot project on the West Coast, then develop the findings into a comprehensive sign-design and implementation book
- redesign and reskin pavilions and other structures to give them a sense of arrival. Retain the donor lists and integrate them into the design.
- develop the national map: select and name regional segments of the Trans Canada Trail where an existing brand does not exist. Select and name destinations: sites and views along the trail which should be emphasized. Have regional segment maps produced.
