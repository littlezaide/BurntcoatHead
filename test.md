# Batoche historical brief

# site summary

Batoche displays the remains of the village of Batoche on the banks of the South Saskatchewan River. It was the last battlefield in the Northwest Rebellion of 1885. Louis Riel selected Batoche as the headquarters of his "Provisional Government of Saskatchewan". Several buildings have been restored within the site. The site depicts the lifestyles of the Métis of Batoche between 1860 and 1900 - the trails they walked, their homes, their church, and the Battle of Batoche, May 9-12, 1885.

The Northcote drifts downstream until later that night when the damage is repaired.
