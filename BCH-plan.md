## What is in this Document? 

This document outlines an interpretive vision that will supplement and augment the Burntcoat Head site. We propose interventions which will help visitors understand the significance of the stories and events, and in doing so, encourage further visitation to the site and a longer stay in the region. The interpretive plan is a foundation to be drawn from for further interpretive development as well as exterior and interior improvements at the site and in the lighthouse, including exhibit concepts, natural play, new media technology, public art and gateway signage.

The plan is a high level interpreticve overview, indicating which themes and stories should be told at the site.

The scope of this project includes developing a interpretive and gateway signage concept as well as finished print-ready panel designs. This document is the first phase; more detailed designs will be needed for later stages of the project.

# Project Analysis

## Existing Conditions

Burntcoat Head is a 1.4ha (3.5 acre) municipal park on a promontory head in the southern coast of Cobequid Bay in Nova Scotia, within the larger Bay of Fundy. At the northern side of the park, there is direct access for visitors to tidal flats in the bay, when at low tide, as well as exposure to the surrounding coastal landscape. Both the seabed access and the striking coastal landscape are primary draws to the park.

The site contains a non-working lighthouse, recreated in the 1990s as a replica of a former working lighthouse on the same spot which was decommissioned and destroyed in the 1970s. The museum is currently the visitors' centre and a museum containing interpretive content on the tides, the natural environment, and the community's socio-economic history. 

Adjacent to the lighthouse is a set of outhouses, which are the only facilities on-site. The access to the park is via a very wide, poorly graded gravel road. 

## prior planning documents

In 2014, BDA Landscape Architects and RMA Tourism produced a master plan for the site: the *Burntcoat Head Park Upgrading and Enhancement Project*.

In order to improve the visitor experience, the plan suggests enhancements to park access and to the visitor experience within the park:

- development of coastal viewing opportunities
- narrowing the access road to 7m width
- creation of a coastal walking trail
- creation of an interpretive plan
- wayfinding signage

Planned infrastructure upgrades include parking lot, gravel walkways, washrooms, new stair access to beach, interpretive centre upgrades, welcome plaza

## The role of interpretation

### The challenge

Burntcoat head is a marvelously wild landscape, ripe with discoveries and dangers. The challenge is to educate visitors without marring this natural landscape. Man-made objects should be designed to recede into the background, and wherever possible they should frame vistas and views rather than be the focal point of spaces.

The spectacle is the scenery, any objects added should help people understand the story without competing for attention.

## Understanding Audiences: Design Implications

**2010 VES Overview EXAMPLE to be fleshed out with NS #s**

For the purposes of this exhibit design plan, the consultant team referred to the 2007-2008 Exit Survey for Prince Edward Island. Key statistics and information presented in this document has informed the conceptual design for new exhibitry at the Borden Gateway Centre. Understanding Island visitation will ensure that new interpretive experiences at the Borden Gateway Centre are meaningful, engaging, and reflect the desires and needs of visitors to the Island. 

Based on the information gleaned from the Exit Survey, several important implications for displays at the Gateway Centre emerge: 

*The majority of those visiting the Island are repeat visitors.*

This high rate of repeat visitation means that there is a very low percentage of first-time visitors. As a result, visitors must be able to view the Gateway Centre as a place that is unique and memorable, and more than just another tourist centre. It is important that repeat visitors feel confident they will encounter new things to
see and do. Tourism products should be refreshed frequently and programming will become crucial. Strong program organization and management by the owner and operators will be required, with support from museum sites and private organizations. Changeable displays are also important: typical “overview” displays must go beyond basic information, providing added value that will appeal to repeat visitors. Furthermore, repeat visitors must be made aware of the Gateway Centre before they arrive – through web, signage, and icons – to overcome past perceptions and the “been there, done that” mentality. 

* There is an opportunity to encourage visitation to alternate destinations. As a result, displays must highlight destinations that are less visited across the Island.*

Visitors are attracted to the Island’s natural beauty and pastoral settings, as well as its beaches and coastlines. Displays must emphasize these elements, perhaps using them as backdrops (the context) for the promotion of the Island’s heritage and culture (i.e., hook visitors to explore the Island heritage and culture through the Island’s stunning landscapes). 

Shopping for local crafts, souvenirs, and antiques is the third major activity visitors to the Island participate in overall. This means that visitors to the Gateway Centre will be interested in retail opportunities as well as exploring the Island’s heritage. As a result, a careful selection of vendors on site to promote their offerings will be necessary to create a balance between heritage and culture, and retail experiences. 

Older couples represent a significant percentage of fall/winter visitors. Displays should take this audience demographic into account by providing a balance between content that relates to semi-recent history, objects, etc., and those that would appeal to an older demographic. Stories should be selected according to a full range of relevant criteria, rather than solely curatorial or historical merit. Over 60% of visitors are without children in the summer, and over 80% without children in the winter. Kid- friendly exhibits are therefore not as crucial as one might expect, and can be given less prominence. They should not be overlooked, however, as locals may benefit from this kind of exhibit and visitors with children (representing 20-40%) will also. 

Visitors are familiar with the Island. Displays should have a friendly, familiar approach to reflect this familiarity with people and places. Moreover, summer visits appear to be linked with places, while fall/winter visits are linked to people. Appealing to the visitor’s personal experiences and favourites places will be important. Displays should take this into account, and may want to consider changing to reflect this seasonal shift. Furthermore, large percentages of visitors hail from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. This means that there is some familiarity with PEI cultures and icons already. Grabbing the attention of repeat visitors when promoting heritage and culture is therefore essential. This can be achieved through new or unusual icons and changing displays, but should be developed in concert with what people expect or are looking for from their visit to the Island. 

# Exhibit Design Plan & Heritage Interpretive Strategy

During the winter months, 93% of those travelling to the Island are repeat visitors. Strategic planning in the winter off-season is therefore necessary. The Borden Gateway Centre must be open (and active) year-round, encouraging visitors to stop. As the Exit Survey indicates, “refreshing tourism products is important in the winter because the visitors coming here during that time of year will already be familiar with past offerings.” Fall events and programs (e.g., those linked to food or wine) would be popular during this time. The Gateway Centre should take advantage of the holiday season to promote stories and destinations. 

79% of travellers leaving the Island do so via the Confederation Bridge. These travellers are a highly untapped market that can be captured through the appeal of “last minute” gifts or a quick coffee for the road. The addition of high quality food and retail operators are therefore important, as are comfortable spaces. Opportunity exists to peak these departing travellers with information about things they did not notice or visit during their stay that can be included “next time,” thereby increasing the potential for a return visit. An opportunity for travellers to leave their memories, photos, and stories also exists, and would encourage visitors to “check back in” at a later date. 

As an audience segment, residents should not be overlooked. Although no data exists to define what residents require, or who from the Island would visit, residents are a key audience for the Borden Gateway Centre – especially those that reside within a 30 minute drive of the Centre. The potential for visits by school groups and local residents is significant. Residents become especially important in the winter off-season. As the Exit Survey indicates, this season is dominated by visits to family and friends. As a result, winter tourism products must also be attractive to the families and friends who live in PEI that visitors come to spend time with and that want to do interesting things with their visitors. 

# Project Goals 

As part of the December startup workshop, the steering committee outlined the goals for Burntcoat Head project which were later refined during a draft presentation and working session in December 2014. The overall intent of the interpretive plan is to ensure that every story has a connection to the tides.
- Communicate the international significance of the site: elaborate
Increase visitation from 9k visitors to 25k visitors within 5 years **elaborate**
Create a ‘must-see’ destination within East Hants and along the Bay of Fundy. **elaborate**
Preserve the natural setting without overdeveloping **elaborate**
Encourage other municipalities and sites to collaborate on a larger Fundy strategy **elaborate**
Connect the stories at Burntcoat Head to larger regional stories **elaborate**

# Thematic Structure 

A key part of the interpretive planning process is the development of a thematic structure: the filter through which all interpretation is organized. This approach is guided by interpretive themes. 
This section presents the thematic structure that will inform the exhibits and experiences at the Borden Gateway Centre, and the interpretive media we will use to ensure that these experiences are meaningful and engaging. The thematic structure should also be considered with regard to any architectural design and site development that takes place now, or in the future.

## Why have themes? 

Why have themes? Interpretive planning uses interpretive themes
to unify content, creating an overarching context through which all interpretation is organized and delivered. Themes are not the same as topics or content. Unlike topics or content, interpretive themes express ideas or concepts that, by acting as unique threads running across many topics, help us understand a place. They reflect the “big ideas” communicated to visitors and should answer the question, “what do you want to resonate with visitors after they leave the Borden Gateway Centre?” 

## Thematic Structure 

For interpretation at the Borden Gateway Centre, four sub-themes unified by one stronger, main theme have been developed. These themes will form the foundation of all visitor experiences at the Borden Gateway Centre, creating an overarching rationale that unites topics and stories to produce a powerful, cohesive approach to interpretation. This creates a consistent message to visitors and also clarifies what will not be interpreted. 

Inspiration for the main theme stemmed from a visioning workshop
held with the stakeholder group in January, 2009. During this workshop, participants repeatedly raised the idea that Prince Edward Island’s cultures are still active today: “the people in the past are still doing things today. They are truly living cultures, living on an Island that is still very much alive.” Responses to a visitor experience exercise yielded similar comments, further strengthening this idea. Further information pertaining to this exercise can be found in Section 4.2 Workshop Results: Emerging Visitor Experiences. From these discussions, the following main theme was crafted: 

### Main Theme 

Prince Edward Island’s landscapes – its people, places, tastes, and sounds – are as alive today as they have been for centuries. 

Stakeholder comments, in addition to those provided during the visitor experience exercise, provide a strong rationale for a thematic structure that reflects the people, places, tastes, and sounds that create the vibrant Island stakeholders described, and, in turn, shape the ideal Island experience for visitors to PEI. 

### Sub Themes 

**People**: An Island welcome, stories to share, and memories to leave behind. Places: Discovering special places worth coming back to, again and again. Tastes: Sharing favourite flavours that delight all the senses.

**Sounds**: Catching and following the sounds of Island life. 
These sub-themes will serve as the cornerstone for telling many stories on a varied scale, and will appeal to both visitors and residents. As such, they account for the full range of topics and stories that could be interpreted at the Borden Gateway Centre. In the diagram at right, sample topics and stories have been noted below each sub-theme to help clarify what each sub-theme means and what potential stories and topics could be addressed within it. 

## Design Approach ##

This section outlines the approach to the concept design for future interpretive experiences. It includes the criteria developed at the visioning workshop in January 2009, a conceptual organization for the Gateway Centre, and exhibit design concepts and floor plan options. 

### Visitor Experience Criteria 

Criteria for interpretive exhibits at the Borden Gateway Centre reflect the various challenges and opportunites of the project (as defined in Section Two), as well as creative input from the stakeholders. 

The exhibit design must: 

1. Utilize available resources
2. Make effective use of existing spaces 
3. Ensure that the VIC counter does not move 
4. Feature high visibility (sightlines and views) 
5. Serve various age groups 
6. Balance the information presented (no one focal point; diverse) 
7. Complement retail and food service areas 
8. Safely present artifacts/heritage resources 
9. Feature limited content and interpretive information: “leave them wanting more!” 
10. Include program and demonstration opportunities 
11. Integrate natural and cultural heritage (allow visitors to make connections) 
12. Feature experiences that are not dependent on technology or people 
14. Feature experiences that are roaming and/or changeable 
15. Be bilingual 
16. Integrate the inside and the outside of the facility 
17. Adhere to a practical and phaseable budget
