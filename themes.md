# Burntcoat Head interpretation 

The interpretive planning process uses *themes* to express central ideas to be communicated to visitors of a site; themes organize information in a concise, compelling way which helps visitors relate to a site, while provoking their interest, and revealing something new to them. 

When visitors leave a site, they keep stories in mind; they are left with the impression that a site is an important place and that it was well worth visiting. 

# thematic approach

The concept for the Burntcoat Head park site is based on interpretive themes distilled from discussions with stakeholders in the Municipality of East Hants, the Burntcoat Head Park Association, the Nova Scotia Tourism Agency and the Central Nova Tourism Association as well as from independant research on Burntcoat Head and the Fundy area. 

## content organization

The themes organize how the significance of Burntcoat Head will be communicated to the public, linking tangible resources (e.g. the landscape, the views, monuments) to intangible meanings in ways which will feel relevant to visitors. The "big ideas" as presented are used to:

* help audiences connect varied information in site-relevant ways
* help audiences pay attention and remember more later on
* direct research; call up questions to be explored later on
* provide guidance for creative decisions

It is important to respect the public's time by strategically limiting the number of themes. Few themes, powerfully linked and presented concisely give visitors a powerful, memorable experience, and build a site's brand. 

# thematic ideas

The themes below are draft suggestions presented with the organizing principle of Burntcoat Head as the site of the *World's Highest Tides* at their centre. Each element of site programming, whether interpretive panel, art piece or other form, should relate to the tides, their function and meaning, importance to the human economy as well as ocean and coastal ecology. 

## hosting / welcoming / orienting

- This sign performs the function of the host of the household, welcoming guests into the house. It lets guests know that they are welcome, that their needs will be met with generosity, and informs them of any ground rules that will make their visit safe and rewarding. 
- We introduce the visitor to the options (where they can go, what they can do) and prepare them for the experience they are about to have.
- includes:
	- tidal schedule, on paper or using a set of pre-printed numbers (like figure skating judges holding up signs). Answers the question: when can I see the next low tide? ![score cards](http://www.corbisimages.com/images/Corbis-HU014806.jpg?size=67&uid=9acb6ea0-fc57-4618-945f-571100dea1f7&attachment=1)
	- orientation map showing the highlights of the visitor experience (e.g. the lighthouse, the views, the stairs to the seabed)
- position: at the trail leading from the parking lot to the lighthouse

## the Context of the Bay of Fundy

- metaphor: tides as ocean breath (around 80-100km^3 of seawater entering and leaving per tidal cycle)
- how do tides work? / physics of the seiche, waves moving in opposite directions creating a standing wave

![animation of a seiche](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/standing-wave.gif)

- speed of the water: how fast does it move along the beach, how quickly does it rise vertically up the slopes of the tidal shore?

## a confluence of cycles

- overlapping cycles of time and space - Fundy is about astronomy as much as it is about the ocean, involving the motions of the moon, the sun and the earth; spans of years, months and days

## Home of the World's Highest Tides

- what factors make Burntcoat Head the site of the world's highest tides?
- how are tides actually measured?
- comparison of Burntcoat Head with seas elsewhere (e.g. Mediterranean, North Atlantic) and with the runner up for highest tides in Leaf Basin, Ungava Bay QC.
- use a landscape feature to present the whole Bay of Fundy with relative average tide levels. The apex will be at Burntcoat Head. 

## the Lighthouse(s)

- the 3 different lighthouses and their purpose
- history of the current building and its relevance to the community, after being destroyed in the 1970s and "revived" in the 1990s 

## wildlife 

- focus on a few animals and plants that thrive or are unique to the Fundy environment
	- shorebirds
	- mollusks
	- seaplants

## economy

- human use based on Fundy ecosystem
- fishing 

## Mi'kmaw tradition

- how did Mi'kmaq use the land? 
- are there known uses of Burntcoat Head by the Mi'kmaq? [awaiting a discussion with Tim Bernard, director of history and culture at the Confederacy of Mainland Mi'kmaq]
- creation of Fundy by Kluscap's battle with Beaver 

## the view

- east of the lighthouse, there is a lookoff point looking eastward doesn the Minas Basin. 
- We answer the question "what am I looking at, New Brunswick?" by showing a panorama of sites which a viewer can look at from the east-looking Burntcoat Head lookoff. We might consider exaggerating the topography or showing a bird's-eye or aerial photograph from the same viewpoint, to help the viewer identify the nearby sites, such as:

	- 8km to Economy Point
	- 22km to 5 Islands
	- 41km to Parrsboro
	- 55km to Cape Split
	- 41km to Blomidon
