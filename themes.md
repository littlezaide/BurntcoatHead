# Burntcoat Head interpretation 

The interpretive planning process uses *themes* to express central ideas to be communicated to visitors of a site; themes organize information in a concise, compelling way which helps visitors relate to a site, while provoking their interest, and revealing something new to them. 

When visitors leave a site, they keep stories in mind; they are left with the impression that a site is an important place and that it was well worth visiting. 

# thematic approach

The concept for the Burntcoat Head park site is based on interpretive themes distilled from discussions with stakeholders in the Municipality of East Hants, the Burntcoat Head Park Association, the Nova Scotia Tourism Agency and the Central Nova Tourism Association as well as from independant research on Burntcoat Head and the Fundy area. 

## content organization

The themes organize how the significance of Burntcoat Head will be communicated to the public, linking tangible resources (e.g. the landscape, the views, monuments) to intangible meanings in ways which will feel relevant to visitors. The "big ideas" as presented are used to:

* help audiences connect varied information in site-relevant ways
* help audiences pay attention and remember more later on
* direct research; call up questions to be explored later on
* provide guidance for creative decisions

It is important to respect the public's time by strategically limiting the number of themes. Few themes, powerfully linked and presented concisely give visitors a powerful, memorable experience, and build a site's brand. 

# thematic ideas

The themes below are draft suggestions presented with the organizing principle of Burntcoat Head as the site of the *World's Highest Tides* at their centre. Each element of site programming, whether interpretive panel, art piece or other form, should relate to the tides, their function and meaning, importance to the human economy as well as ocean and coastal ecology. 

## hosting / welcoming / orienting

![existing entrance to site over footbridge](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3923569/5492440/e4b1ac0c-86b7-11e4-8920-c149a6e5b0e3.JPG)

- This sign performs the function of the host of the household, welcoming guests into the house. It lets guests know that they are welcome, that their needs will be met with generosity, and informs them of any ground rules that will make their visit safe and rewarding. 
- We introduce the visitor to the options (where they can go, what they can do) and prepare them for the experience they are about to have.
- includes:
	- tidal schedule, on paper or using a set of pre-printed numbers (like figure skating judges holding up signs). Answers the question: when can I see the next low tide? ![score cards](http://www.corbisimages.com/images/Corbis-HU014806.jpg?size=67&uid=9acb6ea0-fc57-4618-945f-571100dea1f7&attachment=1)
	- orientation map showing the highlights of the visitor experience (e.g. the lighthouse, the views, the stairs to the seabed)
- location: at the trail leading from the parking lot to the lighthouse

## the Context of the Bay of Fundy

![the northwestern lookoff](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3923569/5492526/8f383394-86b8-11e4-8bdc-61a3801b9f7a.JPG)

- location: at the lighthouse look-out, giving the widest view of the Cobequid Bay
- metaphor: tides as ocean breath (around 80-100km^3 of seawater entering and leaving per tidal cycle)
- how do tides work? / physics of the seiche, waves moving in opposite directions creating a standing wave

![animation of a seiche](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/standing-wave.gif)

- speed of the water: how fast does it move along the beach, how quickly does it rise vertically up the slopes of the tidal shore?

### notes

- tidal long wave moves across the bay at (on average) 200km/h 
- enumeration of factors in storm tides, in increasing order of effect:
	1. increasing tidal range in bay of fundy 
	2. post-glacial sea-level rise
	3. sun's position relative to long axis of moon's orbit
	4. declination of moon and sun to earth's equator
	5. atmospheric disturbance
	6. variable position of moon, sun & earth to each other
	7. variable distance between earth and moon

## The Big Tides

Fundy is about astronomy as much as it is about the ocean, involving the motions of the moon, the sun, and the earth around each other. 

By far, the largest effect on the height of the oceans is the twice daily change in the moon's position relative to the earth's surface. Simply put, where the moon is nearest or at its furthest point away, the tides are highest. Where the moon is 1/4 or 3/4 of a cycle around, the tides are lowest. This cycle is a little bit longer than a earth day, at 12 hours and 25 minutes.

Other planetary cycles modulate those twice-daily tides, every once and a while making the high tides higher and low tides lower. 

![causes of tides](http://www.cockpitcards.co.uk/userimages/Moon-and-Sun-Tidal-causes.jpg)

Spring tides: The sun also exerts a pull on the oceans, though its pull is weaker than the moon's. When the sun and moon are in line with the earth, the tides are higher than normal because the gravitational pull of the moon and sun add up, and these are called spring tides. They are so called because the tides jump higher, like a metal coil when released (and not having anything to do with the season). 

Perigean tides: As the moon orbits the earth every 27.322 days, it becomes closer to the earth twice in the cycle. Where the moon is closest to the earth, its gravitational pull is stronger, and tides are higher. 

Declination of the moon: as the moon rotates around the earth, its distance to earth's the equator changes, moving north 23.5deg, and then south 23.5deg. When the moon is closest to the equator, higher tides occur. 

Every 206 days the Perigean (Moon coming closest to Earth) and Spring tide (sun and moon in line) cycles line up. Because the 2 effects are additive, the tides become higher. 

Every 18 years 11 days and 8 hours the moon, sun, and earth all line up in such a way as to cause the largest tides possible. Called the *Saros* cycle, the Bay's tides can be affected for weeks or even months. 

Badly timed storms can push the tides even higher. Saxby Gale of 1869 may have raised the highest tides 1.5-2m higher than the highest astronomical tides, causing massive flooding.

- what factors make Burntcoat Head the site of the world's highest tides?
- how are tides actually measured? We'll show the device that measured the tides and briefly how it works. 
- comparison of Burntcoat Head with seas elsewhere (e.g. Mediterranean, North Atlantic) and with the runner up for highest tides in Leaf Basin, Ungava Bay QC. - show the relative heights, either averages or peaks. 
- potentially use a landscape feature to present the whole Bay of Fundy with relative average tide levels. The apex would be at Burntcoat Head. 

### other tides 

- Halifax tidal range: 2.0m
- Mediterranean generally 30cm - 1m, highest in Gulf of Gab√®s in Tunisia with 2.1m range
- Vancouver 4.9m
- Iqaluit NU 12.0m

## the Lighthouse(s)

![the lighthouse](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3923569/5492566/cb1c34a0-86b8-11e4-8ac4-b9e692886e84.JPG)

- location: at plaza in front of lighthouse
- the 3 different lighthouses and their purpose
- history of the current building and its relevance to the community, after being destroyed in the 1970s by the Dep't of Transportation and "revived" by the community in the 1990s 
- first lighthouse built in 1858 

## wildlife 

### theme

- focus on a few animals and plants that thrive or are unique to the Fundy environment
- stirring of the seabed which reveals nutrients and small creatures 4 times a day
	- shorebirds
	- mollusks
	- seaplants
- e.g. Atlantic Mud Piddock ![Atlantic mud piddock](http://www.jaxshells.org/0116vv.jpg)

### notes

- on land, the air, soil and groundwater all interact to provide for the needs of living things; in the the ocean, it's the water which provides
- zone of shore exposed to both seawater and air twice a day
- tidal currents bring in nutrients and sediments and also erode and continually change the seabed
- mudflats at the head of the bay are important to migratory shorebirds and small mammals
- concentrations of dissolved nutrients favour dense growths of algae and mussels, which feed on particles in suspension 
- currents benefit marine organisms by dispersing eggs and larvae

## human economy

- human use based on Fundy ecosystem
- fishing 
- dyking to produce farmland; because of the wide tidal range, much of the day the sea level is well below the grade of marshlands and lakes, making it ideal for draining (much faster and easier than clearing forested uplands in the 18th century). 

## Mi'kmaw tradition

![Glooscap Creates the West Isles, by artist Art MacKay](http://bayoffundy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/GlooscapCreatesWestIsles6-1024x707.jpg)

- are there known uses of Burntcoat Head by the Mi'kmaq? [stories to be developed in interview with *Tim Bernard*, director of history and culture at the Confederacy of Mainland Mi'kmaq to follow in January 2015]
- creation of Fundy by Kluscap's battle with Beaver 

## the view

![eastern view](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3923569/5492521/7c2acdb6-86b8-11e4-9cb4-94e5129eeab4.JPG)

- east of the lighthouse, there is a lookoff point looking eastward doesn the Minas Basin. 
- We answer the question "what am I looking at, New Brunswick?" by showing a panorama of sites which a viewer can look at from the east-looking Burntcoat Head lookoff. We might consider exaggerating the topography or showing a bird's-eye or aerial photograph from the same viewpoint, to help the viewer identify the nearby sites, such as:

	- 8km to Economy Point
	- 22km to 5 Islands
	- 41km to Parrsboro
	- 55km to Cape Split
	- 41km to Blomidon
