This is the cube structure which gives people a sense of scale of just how much water enters and leaves the Bay of Fundy twice daily.

## A Lovely Creeping Thing from 200 Million Years Ago

In 1999, a father and son walked along the shores of Burntcoat Head and made a big find in the mud: the skull of a creature that had never been seen before. The skull was identified as from the late triassic period, over 220 million years ago, possibly predating dinosaurs. Today, the creature which George and Sandy Hyrnewich stumbled across is called *Teraterpeton hrynewichorum*: the latter name is in honour of the discoverers, while the former name means "wonderful creeping thing (i.e. reptile)" in Greek. 

Say it with me: **tehra-TEHR-peton rehn-wich-OH-rum**. 

More like a reptile than a mammal or bird, the teraterpeton has square teeth, making it a likely plant-eater. It's time on earth predates water being in the bay of fundy. 

The teraterpeton has not since been found elsewhere. As the Bay of Fundy erodes over time, more examples of life from long ago may be revealed in the mud.

is because of tidal action

### Burntcoat Tides: Highest in the World

What does it mean to have the highest tides? 
How are they measured? 

### Forming Fundy
### The Land/Sea Seam: Erosion & Retreat

### 6 Hour Volume: 100 km^3 of water every 6 hours

A gigantic amount of water enters the bay of fundy and leaves again, not once, but twice daily. 

That would be 63 trillion Imperial pints of beer, or at least 500 times the total worldwide production of beer. 

## Ecology

### Prehistoric Life: Plants and animals of the region. Fossils

### Local Tragedies

### What's in a Name?



This settlement is located on a promontory between Moose Cove and Noel Bay on the Cobequid shore of Nova Scotia. According to legend the place received its name (1) when Thomas and Robert Faulkner were burning marsh in 1795 and lost a coat by hanging it on bushes too near the fire, or (2) when the crew of a Privateer landed to spend the night, one of the men got too near the fire and set his coat ablaze, the others awakening with the cry, "Burnt Coat."

By 1839 there were five or six families living here.

A Methodist church in process of construction for several years, was complete in April, 1858.

A school probably built in the early 19th century, was condemned in 1874.

A lighthouse was erected in 1859. Its light was first exhibited on October 20.

A Postal Way Office was established under Robert Falconer on July 1, 1866.

Farming, some lumbering and fishing are the main industries.

Population in 1956 was 74.
