## Physical Geography

### Burntcoat Tides: Highest in the World

What does it mean to have the highest tides? 
How are they measured? 

### Forming Fundy
### The Land/Sea Seam: Erosion & Retreat

### 6 Hour Volume: 100 km^3 of water every 6 hours

A gigantic amount of water enters the bay of fundy and leaves again, not once, but twice daily. 

That would be 63 trillion Imperial pints of beer, or at least 500 times the total worldwide production of beer. 

## Ecology

### Prehistoric Life: Plants and animals of the region. Fossils

In 1999, a father and son walked along the shores of Burntcoat Head and made a big find in the mud: the skull of a creature that had never been seen before. The skull was identified as from the late triassic period, over 220 million years ago, possibly predating dinosaurs. Today, the creature which George and Sandy Hyrnewich stumbled across is called *Teraterpeton hrynewichorum*: the latter name is in honour of the discoverers, while the former name means "wonderful creeping thing (i.e. reptile)" in Greek. 

Say it with me: tehra-TEHR-peton rehn-wich-OH-rum. 

More like a reptile than a mammal or bird, the teraterpeton has square teeth, making it a likely plant-eater. It's time on earth predates water being in the bay of fundy. 

The teraterpeton has not since been found elsewhere. As the Bay of Fundy erodes over time, more examples of life from long ago may be revealed in the mud.
