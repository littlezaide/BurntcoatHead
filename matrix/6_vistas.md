You're looking northwest, towards Five Islands Provincial Park, the Town of Parrsboro and Economy Point. Burntcoat Head is one of 2 arms of the head of Bay of Fundy, called Cobequid Bay. The whole Bay of Fundy is 400km long. 

If it's not time for a sunset just yet, you should consider coming back when it is.
