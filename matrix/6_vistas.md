## PRIMARY INFORMATION

## Look Waaay Out

The whole Bay of Fundy is 400km long and stretches along southwest Nova Scotia and southern New Brunswick to touch northern Maine. Burntcoat Head is on one of two arms at the head of Bay of Fundy, called Cobequid Bay. Right now, you’re looking northwest at Nova Scotia sites: towards Five Islands Pro- vincial Park, the town of Parrsboro, and Economy Point. You can’t see New Brunswick from here.

If it’s not sundown just yet, consider coming back when it is. Our sunsets are as exceptional as our tides.

## SECONDARY INFORMATION

## How the Bay was Made

Before Fundy was formed, 250 million years ago, the world’s continents were all joined into one land- mass, called Pangaea. When Pangaea began to split apart, the area where Fundy is now started to sink, creating a very large, deep fissure. The dunes that gradually filled the fissure turned into the soft red sandstone that we see today here at Burntcoat Head and all around the Bay of Fundy Fundy shoreline.

Lava from the earth’s core emerged through the fissure and, once cooled, produced black basalt rock. It’s the harder rock visible at Cape Split and Cape Chignecto. The same rock formed the western edges of France and Spain, West Africa and eastern North and South America.

Water filled in the fissure just 9000 years ago. Before that, you could easily keep your socks dry walking from Parrsboro to Kentville.
