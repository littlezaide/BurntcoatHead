Look way out: the whole Bay of Fundy is 400km long and reaches along SW Nova Scotia and Southern New Brunswick to touch Northern Maine. Right now, you're looking northwest at Nova Scotian sites: towards Five Islands Provincial Park, the Town of Parrsboro and Economy Point. Burntcoat Head is in one of 2 arms of the head of Bay of Fundy, called Cobequid Bay. 

[note: show distances to nearby sites on image?]
