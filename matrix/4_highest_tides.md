## PRIMARY INFORMATION: WORLD RECORD TIDE

Approximately every 6 hours and 12.5 minutes, 100 cubic kilometers of water enter or leave the Bay of Fundy. Imagine a cube of that size: 100km long by 100km wide by 100km high. It would tower over the province, just as this structure towers over the outline of Nova Scotia at your feet.

In 1975, Guinness World Records named Burntcoat Head the site of the World’s Highest Tides. The Bay of Fundy’s daily flow would equal 63 trillion imperial pints of Guinness, or at least 500 times the total worldwide production of beer.

PRIMARY INFORMATION: MEASURING TIDES

Long ago, the tidal range was measured simply by marking the side of a pillar holding up a pier at different times. Of course, it’s not just a vertical distance: as the tide goes out, the bay recedes to the lowest point of land, sometimes hundreds of metres away from shore.

Today, fortunately, we have electronic methods of measuring water. In 1998, hydrographers placed water level recorders on the bottom of the Bay off Burntcoat Head. The device measured the pressure of the column of water above, and combined with measurements of salinity and temperature, gave a water level precise to within centimetres.

## SECONDARY INFORMATION: HOW & WHY TIDES OCCUR

Why does the ocean's water level move up and down daily? Oceans worldwide are affected by the gravitational pulls of both sun and moon. Actually, the air and the ground are also moved by the changing positions of earth, sun and moon, but only the ocean moves in a way which we can see and feel. 

The moon's gravity does most of the work. 

Because the earth rotates, the moon's place in the sky is always changing. The moon passes over a different quarter of the earth every 6 hours & 12.5 minutes and the ocean level rises or falls, following that moon. When the moon is overhead or at the far side of the earth, it pulls the ocean towards it, resulting in a high tide. But when the moon is a quarter away in either direction, the pull is weaker, and the tide is low. At low tide, the moon is still pulling on the ocean, just somewhere else!

The sun's gravity also affects the ocean. Twice a month, at the new and full moons, the earth, moon and sun are all in a line. The gravity of sun and moon add up, and the tides rise even higher than normal. We call them **spring tides**, but they have nothing to do with the season, and everything to do with the extra *bounce* of the tides. 

Seawater flows into the Bay of Fundy as tides change from low to high, and it creates a single wave called a *seiche*. The length of time the seiche wave takes to pass from one end of the bay to the other, from Digby to Cobequid Bay just past Burntcoat Head, is about the same as the period between high tide and low tide. The seiche wave adds to the already rising tidal water levels. Imagine pushing someone on a swing: if you push the person at just the right time, as they are moving away from you, you are adding energy to their motion with each swing, and they move higher and higher. The seiche is perfectly timed to add to the water levels, such that the highest point which is visible to us is at Burntcoat Head.

# NOTES NOTES NOTES - DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE IN ANY DOCUMENT

Tides vary around the world based on many factors. In the open Atlantic as well as the coastal Mediterranean Ocean, tidal range is generally within a few metres. On the Pacific coast, the range is a little bit higher. There are a few spots which have a range close to that of Burntcoat Head, including Leaf Basin on the Ungava Peninsula of far northern Québec.
