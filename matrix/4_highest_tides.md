# Highest Tides

Location: on path to stairway

Description: walk-through cubic structure to give sense of scale of tidal water volume; includes explanatory panels and outline of Nova Scotia on the ground

## inside structure

## PRIMARY INFORMATION: WORLD RECORD TIDE

Every 6 hours and 25 minutes, 100 cubic kilometers of water enter or leave the Bay of Fundy. Imagine a cube of that size: 100km long by 100km wide by 100km high. It would tower over the province, just as this structure towers over the outline of Nova Scotia at your feet.

In 1975, Guinness World Records named Burntcoat Head the site of the World’s Highest Tides. The Bay of Fundy’s daily flow would equal 63 trillion imperial pints of Guinness, or at least 500 times the total world- wide production of beer.

PRIMARY INFORMATION: MEASURING TIDES

Long ago, the tidal range was measured simply by marking the side of a pillar holding up a pier at differ- ent times. Of course, it’s not just a vertical distance: as the tide goes out, the bay recedes to the lowest point of land, sometimes hundreds of metres away from shore.

Today, fortunately, we have electronic methods of measuring water. In 1998, hydrographers placed water level recorders on the bottom of the Bay off Burntcoat Head. The device measured the pressure of the column of water above, and combined with measurements of salinity and temperature, gave a water level precise to within centimetres.

structure: the large cube which people can walk through, giving them a sense of scale of just how much water enters and leaves the Bay of Fundy twice daily. 

## just how much water are we talking about?

Every 6 hours and 25 minutes, 100km^3 of water enters or leaves the Bay of Fundy. Imagine a cube of that size: 100km long by 100km wide by 100km high. It would tower over the province, just as this structure towers over the outline of Nova Scotia's coast marked on the path. 

In 1975, Guiness World Records named Burntcoat Head the site of the World’s Highest Tides. The Bay of Fundy's flow would equal 63 trillion Imperial pints of Guiness, or at least 500 times the total worldwide production of beer. 

## measuring the tides

Long ago, the tidal range was measured simply by marking the side of a pier at different times. This was a pretty loose measure, as the tide isn't simply a vertical distance; as the tide goes out, the water in the bay recedes to the lowest point of land, which can be hundreds of metres away from shore. 

Fortunately, we now have electronic methods of measuring water. In 1998, hydrographers placed a water level recorder on the bottom of the bay off Burntcoat Head. The device measured pressure of the column of water above, and combined with measurements of salinity (i.e. saltiness) and temperature, gave a water lever precise to within centimetres. 

Tides vary around the world based on many factors. In the open Atlantic as well as the coastal Mediterranean Ocean, tidal range is generally within a few metres. On the Pacific coast, the range is a little bit higher. There are a few spots which have a range close to that of Burntcoat Head, including Leaf Basin on the Ungava Peninsula of far northern Québec.
