Geology of the Bay

## A Lovely Creeping Thing from 220 Million Years Ago

In 1999, a father and son walked along the shores of Burntcoat Head and made a big find in the mud: the skull of a creature that had never been seen before. The skull was identified as from the late triassic period, over 220 million years ago, possibly predating dinosaurs. Today, the creature which George and Sandy Hyrnewich stumbled across is called *Teraterpeton hrynewichorum*: the latter name is in honour of the discoverers, while the former name means "wonderful creeping thing (i.e. reptile)" in Greek. 

Say it with me: **tehra-TEHR-peton rehn-wich-OH-rum**. 

More like a reptile than a mammal or bird, the teraterpeton has square teeth, making it a likely plant-eater. It's time on earth predates water being in the bay of fundy. 

The teraterpeton has not since been found elsewhere. As the Bay of Fundy erodes over time, more examples of life from long ago may be revealed in the mud. 

### erosion

The shore at Burntcoat Head is made of relatively soft stuff - th eunique red sandstone.

### how the bay was made

Before Fundy was formed, 250 million years ago, the world's continents were all joined into one landmass, called *Pangaea*. When Pangaea began to split apart, the area where Fundy is now started to sink, creating a very deep fissure. The dunes that were created around the coastal areas of the fissure gradually turned into the soft red sandstone that we see today eroding along the Burntcoat Head shoreline. 

Lava from the earth's core came up through the fissure and once cooled, produced black basalt rock. It's the harder rock one can see at Cape Split and Cape Chignecto. The same rock formed the western edges of France and Spain, West Africa and eastern North and South America. 

Water filled in the bay just 9000 years ago. Before that, you could easily keep your socks dry walking from Parrsboro to Kentville.

## notes from Margo's meeting w/Tim Fedak


Tim called the cliffs around Fundy “very active” and dangerous. Even a golf ball-sized piece dropping off could kill.
