Geology of the Bay

## A Lovely Creeping Thing from 220 Million Years Ago

In 1999, a father and son walked along the shores of Burntcoat Head and made a big find in the mud: the skull of a creature that had never been seen before. The skull was identified as from the late triassic period, over 220 million years ago, possibly predating dinosaurs. Today, the creature which George and Sandy Hyrnewich stumbled across is called *Teraterpeton hrynewichorum*: the latter name is in honour of the discoverers, while the former name means "wonderful creeping thing (i.e. reptile)" in Greek. 

Say it with me: **tehra-TEHR-peton rehn-wich-OH-rum**. 

More like a reptile than a mammal or bird, the teraterpeton has square teeth, making it a likely plant-eater. It's time on earth predates water being in the bay of fundy. 

The teraterpeton has not since been found elsewhere. As the Bay of Fundy erodes over time, more examples of life from long ago may be revealed in the mud. 

- Effect of erosion on the area, “active cliffs”

Before Fundy was formed, 250 million years ago, the world's continents were all joined into one landmass, called *Pangaea*. When Pangaea began to split apart, the area where Fundy is now started to sink, creating a very deep fissure. Water-borne and wind-borne dunes filled in the fissure, forming the reddish sandstone that is now eroding.

## notes from Margo's meeting w/Tim Fedak

As the “continents” spread, molten lava from the earth’s core emerged and formed black basalt rock that you see at Cape Split and Cape Chignecto (Tim called it called North Mountain Basalt), as well as along the western edge of Europe (France, Iberia, etc.) and Africa, as well as the eastern edge of N & S America. 

About 9000 years ago (so recently! Who knew?) water filled in the fissure. Before that, one could walk from Parrsboro to Kentville. 

Tim called the cliffs around Fundy “very active” and dangerous. Even a golf ball-sized piece dropping off could kill.
