# Orientation

A rock-cage structure greets entrants as they enter the Burntcoat Head site from the parking lot. 

## Welcome

Welcome to Burntcoat Head. You're about to experience the world's widest tidal range, at its widest 17 metres (56ft) from lowest low tide to highest high tide. Take in the ever changing vista and learn a bit about the Bay of Fundy, the powerful, twice-daily tidal breath of the Atlantic Ocean.

Burntcoat Head is one of many sites along the 1400km of pristine Bay of Fundy coastline.

The tide in the Bay of Fundy moves from lowest to highest every 6 hours and 25 minutes. There are 2 high and 2 low tides daily, and they occur at different times from day-to-day. 

Burntcoat Head is best viewed at mid- or low- tide. For the chance to explore on the sea floor (temporarily, until the sea takes it back), visit at the next low tide. Even at high tide, the view is still spectacular. Go for a sandwhich and come back - and see just how dramatically the water level has changed.
