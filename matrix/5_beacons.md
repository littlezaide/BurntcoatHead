- Story of three lighthouses
- Why is a lighthouse here?
- Whatâ€™s in a name? Why Burncoat head?
 
This settlement is located on a promontory between Moose Cove and Noel Bay on the Cobequid shore of Nova Scotia. According to legend the place received its name (1) when Thomas and Robert Faulkner were burning marsh in 1795 and lost a coat by hanging it on bushes too near the fire, or (2) when the crew of a Privateer landed to spend the night, one of the men got too near the fire and set his coat ablaze, the others awakening with the cry, "Burnt Coat."

By 1839 there were five or six families living here.

A Methodist church in process of construction for several years, was complete in April, 1858.

A school probably built in the early 19th century, was condemned in 1874.

A lighthouse was erected in 1859. Its light was first exhibited on October 20.

A Postal Way Office was established under Robert Falconer on July 1, 1866.

Farming, some lumbering and fishing are the main industries.

Population in 1956 was 74.
