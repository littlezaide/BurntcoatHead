## PRIMARY INFORMATION

## A Story of Three Lighthouses

The farmers, fishers and foresters who were the early settlers of this area used the bay for transportation. In the 19th century, lighthouses were being built to improve navigation and make boating safer; Burntcoat Head residents petitioned the Nova Scotia governor in the 1850s to build a lighthouse for them. 

The distinctive “flowerpot” island just off Burntcoat Head. Extreme tidal erosion made it necessary to relocate the lighthouse to the “main- land” in XXXX. This lighthouse operated until XXXX, until it was decommissioned and demolished by provincial authorities. At the insistence of the community, their cherished lighthouse was replicated as a non-working version on the same site, and today serves as a museum, commemorating local history.

## SECONDARY INFORMATION: TIDE’S INFLUENCE

These “flowerpot” formations were shaped by erosion caused by the high tides and glaciation over 600 million years.

- Why is a lighthouse here?
- What’s in a name? Why Burncoat head?
 
This settlement is located on a promontory between Moose Cove and Noel Bay on the Cobequid shore of Nova Scotia. According to legend the place received its name (1) when Thomas and Robert Faulkner were burning marsh in 1795 and lost a coat by hanging it on bushes too near the fire, or (2) when the crew of a Privateer landed to spend the night, one of the men got too near the fire and set his coat ablaze, the others awakening with the cry, "Burnt Coat."

By 1839 there were five or six families living here.

A Methodist church in process of construction for several years, was complete in April, 1858.

A school probably built in the early 19th century, was condemned in 1874.

A lighthouse was erected in 1859. Its light was first exhibited on October 20.

A Postal Way Office was established under Robert Falconer on July 1, 1866.

Farming, some lumbering and fishing are the main industries.

Population in 1956 was 74.
