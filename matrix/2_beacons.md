## PRIMARY INFORMATION

## A Story of Three Lighthouses

In the 19th century, lighthouses were being built around Nova Scotia to improve navigation and make boating safer. The shipowners and mariners of Hants County petitioned the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1855 for a grant in order to build a lighthouse on Burntcoat Head. 

A lighthouse was built in 1859 on what was then the headland, but now is the distinctive flowerpot island. The lighthouse had to be moved in 1913 when erosion cut that piece of land off from the mainland — one day the lighthouse keeper found he was no longer able to get to work! 

This lighthouse operated until the 1960s, until it was decommissioned and demolished by federal authorities in 1972. The community rebuilt their cherished lighthouse in the 1990s as a museum, commemorating local history. 

## SECONDARY INFORMATION: TIDE’S INFLUENCE

Flowerpot formations — Bay of Fundy islands with steep cliffs on all sides — are shaped by tidal currents which can erode and narrow a peninsula further and further until it separates from the mainland entirely. The flowerpot at Burntcoat Head was formed in this way.
