### PRIMARY INFORMATION

Welcome to Burntcoat Head Park, site of the world’s highest recorded tides. Here you can experience the most extreme tidal range on earth – 17 metres (56ft) at its widest, from lowest low tide to highest high tide.
Burntcoat Head Park is accessible year-round; the lighthouse museum is open June through October. Bask in the Park’s beautiful and ever-changing vistas, explore its natural treasures, and learn about the Bay of Fundy and the powerful, twice-daily tidal breath of the Atlantic Ocean.

### Burntcoat Head’s Unusual Name

According to legend the place received its name when original residents Thomas and Robert Faulkner were burning marsh in 1795 and hung a coat just a little to close to a fire. Another story tells of the crew of a ship landing to spend the night; one of the men got too near the fire and set his coat ablaze, the others waking to yell, “burnt coat!”

As colourful as these stories are, it’s more likely that “burnt coat” is an English corruption of “Pointe Cloche,” French for “Bell Point.” We know that before 1750, Acadian settler Noel Doiron built a chapel on the west side of Noel Bay, which could have housed a bell. Many Nova Scotia place names have evolved in this way.

### PRIMARY INFO

The tide in the Bay of Fundy moves from lowest to highest every 6 hours and 12.5 minutes. There are two high and two low tides daily, and they occur at different times from day to day.

[include tide-time chart – possibly a chalkboard?]

While the highest tide is Burntcoat Head’s distinction, the best chance to explore the ocean floor is at mid or low tide — briefly, until the sea takes it back. At high tide, the view is still spectacular. Go for a picnic or a hike, and when you come back you’ll see just how dramatically the water level has changed. If your timing is right, you’ll catch one of our splendid sunsets.

### SECONDARY INFO

Burntcoat Head is one of many sites along the 1400km of pristine Bay of Fundy coastline. Once you’ve seen Burntcoat Head, you could take in Cape Split for one of the best hikes in the province, with a breath- taking view. Or visit Fundy Force in Parrsboro to learn about generating energy from the massive Fundy tides. And the Fundy Geological Museum in Parrsboro houses amazing fossils, including the unique and ancient teraterpeton hrynewichorum, discovered right here in Burntcoat Head.
