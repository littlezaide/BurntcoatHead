The Ocean Floor/Ecology
-----------------------
  
The tide raises and lowers the water level, but it isn't just a vertical motion. When the tide is at its lowest, the water moves out to the lowest area of land, in the centre of the bay. That means that some of the ocean floor is revealed twice daily, allowing you to go out and explore. 

As the tide varies, sometimes it can move hundreds of metres out at low tide. Don't go far from shore - once the tide comes back in, in can come back in at around 2cm per minute [check this]. 

A massive amount of water moves in and out of the bay - 100 kilometres cubed every incoming or outgoing tide. Nutrients and oxygen are stirred up and made newly available four times a day. Unfortunately, any sea creatures unable to hold on for dear life aren't able to take advantage of those rich waters, especially at the top of the bay near Burntcoat. 

There is one creature that has it all figured out: the Atlantic Mud Piddock is a bivalve (like clams and scallops) which burrows into the mud-stone of the seabed, and is one of the few creatures able to resist the powerful tidal action. It is unique to the area around Burntcoat Head - it exists elsewhere in the Atlantic, but usually in much warmer waters. 

Larger mammals such as whales and seals tend to avoid coming all the way up the Bay of Fundy into Cobequid Bay because the waters move quickly and it can be hard for them to control their path. It is possible to see them from time to time.
