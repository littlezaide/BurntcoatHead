The Ocean Floor/Ecology
-----------------------

The tide raises and lowers the water level, but it isn't just a vertical motion. At low tide, the water moves out to the lowest area of land in the centre of the bay. That reveals some of the ocean floor twice daily, allowing you to go out onto the seabed to explore.

As the tide varies, sometimes it can move hundreds of metres out at low tide. Don't go far from shore - once the tide starts to rise, it can move quickly and fill the bay in unpredictably. 

A massive amount of water moves in and out of the bay - 100 kilometres cubed every incoming or outgoing tide. Nutrients and oxygen are stirred up and made newly available each tidal change. Unfortunately, any sea creatures unable to hold on for dear life aren't able to take advantage of those rich waters, especially at the top of the bay near Burntcoat. 

However, there is one creature that has it all figured out: the *Atlantic Mud Piddock* is a bivalve (like clams and scallops) which burrows into the mud-stone of the seabed, and is one of the few creatures able to resist the powerful tidal action. It is unique to the area around Burntcoat Head - it does exist elsewhere in the Atlantic, but usually in much warmer waters. 

Larger mammals such as whales and seals tend to avoid coming all the way up the Bay of Fundy into Cobequid Bay because the waters move quickly and it can be hard for them to control their path. It is possible to see them from time to time. 

If you are visiting Burntcoat Head in the late summer, you could be in for a special treat: the mudflats of the Bay of Fundy are host to millions of shorebirds annually, such as plovers and sandpipers. The tiny migratory birds eat as much food as they can before making their long flight to South America; they feed mainly on mudshrimp, which come to the surface in the late summer to breed.
