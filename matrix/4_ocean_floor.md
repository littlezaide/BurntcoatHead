The Ocean Floor/Ecology
-----------------------
  
The tide raises and lowers the water level, but it isn't just a vertical motion. When the tide is at its lowest, the water moves out to the lowest area of land, in the centre of the bay. That means that some of the ocean floor is revealed twice daily, allowing you to go out and explore. 

As the tide varies, sometimes it can move hundreds of metres out at low tide. Don't go far from shore - once the tide comes back in, in can come back in at around 2cm per minute [check this]. 

As the massive amount of water moves in and out of the bay - 100 kilometres cubed every incoming or outgoing tide. Four times a day krill, . Any sea creatures unable to hold on for dear life aren't able to take advantage of the rich waters, especially at the top of the bay near Burntcoat. There is one creature that has it all figured out. The Atlantic Mud Piddock is a bivalve (like clams and scallops) which burrows into the mud-stone of the seabed, and is one of the few creatures able to resist the powerful tidal action. It is unique to the area around Burntcoat Head - it exists elsewhere in the Atlantic, but usually in much warmer waters.  

- Whatâ€™s here? pinnock, plovers, etc.

## secondary

- Presence of these species is because of tidal action
