# The Ocean Floor


The tide raises and lowers the water level, but it isn't just a vertical motion. At low tide, the water moves out to the lowest area of land in the centre of the bay. That reveals some of the ocean floor twice daily, allowing you to go out onto the seabed to explore. Sometimes the water can move hundreds of metres out at low tide. Don't go too far from shore. Once the tide starts to rise again, it can move quickly and fill the bay in unpredictably. 

# Holding on for Dear Life

A massive amount of water moves in and out of the bay: 100km^3 every incoming or outgoing tide. Nutrients and oxygen are stirred up and made newly available with each tidal change. Unfortunately, any sea creatures unable to hold on for dear life can't take advantage of the rich waters, especially at the top of the bay near Burntcoat. 

However, there is one creature that has it all figured out: the *Atlantic Mud Piddock* is a bivalve (like clams and scallops) which burrows into the mud-stone of the seabed, and is one of the few creatures able to resist the powerful tidal action. It is unique to a small area around Burntcoat Head. While it does exist elsewhere in the Atlantic, it is usually in much warmer waters.

# Big Mammals

Larger mammals such as whales and seals love the lower Bay of Fundy but avoid coming northeast into the Minas Basin and Cobequid Bay because the channels are narrow and waters move quickly. One wrong move and a whale could be beached on land when the tide goes out. Nevertheless, it is possible to see them taking some risks from time to time. 

# Invasion of the Semi-Palmated

If you are visiting Burntcoat Head in the late summer, you could be in for a special treat: the mudflats of the Bay of Fundy are host to millions of shorebirds annually, such as *semi-palmated plovers* and *sandpipers* and the impossibly tiny *least sandpiper*. The migratory birds eat as much food as they can before making their long flight to South America; they feed mainly on mudshrimp, which come to the mud's surface in the late summer to breed. Burntcoat Head is host to tens of thousands of these birds every year.
