The Ocean Floor/Ecology
-----------------------
  
The tide raises and lowers the water level, but it isn't just a vertical motion. When the tide is at its lowest, the water moves out to the lowest area of land, in the centre of the bay. That means that some of the ocean floor is revealed twice daily, allowing you to go out and explore. 

As the tide varies, sometimes it can move hundreds of metres out at low tide. Don't go far from shore - once the tide comes back in, in can come back in at around 2cm per minute [check this]. 

- How far out the tide goes
- Whatâ€™s here? pinnock, plovers, etc.

## secondary

- Presence of these species is because of tidal action
