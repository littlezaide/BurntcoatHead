Highest Tides 
-------------

This is the cube structure which gives people a sense of scale of just how much water enters and leaves the Bay of Fundy twice daily. 

## primary

Every 6 hours and 25 minutes, 100km^3 of water enters or leaves the Bay of Fundy. Imagine a cube of that size: 100km long by 100km wide by 100km high. It would tower over the province, just as this structure does. 

In 1975, Guiness World Records named Burntcoat Head the site of the Worldâ€™s Highest Tides. hTe 100km^3 of water would be 63 trillion Imperial pints of Guiness, or at least 500 times the total worldwide production of beer.
