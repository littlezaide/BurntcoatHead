Highest Tides 
-------------

This is the cube structure which gives people a sense of scale of just how much water enters and leaves the Bay of Fundy twice daily. 

## primary

Every 6 hours and 25 minutes, 100km^3 of water enters or leaves the Bay of Fundy. Imagine a cube of that size: 100km long by 100km wide by 100km high. It would tower over the province, just as this structure towers over the outline of Nova Scotia's coast marked on the path. 

In 1975, Guiness World Records named Burntcoat Head the site of the Worldâ€™s Highest Tides. The Bay of Fundy's flow would equal 63 trillion Imperial pints of Guiness, or at least 500 times the total worldwide production of beer. 

At one time, the tidal range was measured by marking the side of a pillar holding up a pier at different times. Of course it's not just a vertical distance: as the tide goes out, the bay recedes to the lowest point of land, sometimes hundreds of metres away from shore. 

Today, fortunately, we have electronic methods of measuring water which are both precise and easy to use.
