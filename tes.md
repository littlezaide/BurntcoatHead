- many government partners are fully resourced but have their own signage rules and priorities which may not align with those of the TCT
- provincial highway ministries lack commitment to TCT project for highway sections (many of these are unsigned - it is not clear how a trail user gets to the end of one trail to the next via a roadway segment)
- lack of wayfinding signage at decision points, or signs are confusing or redundant with other signage systems
- gov't trail managers can't accept $ or volunteers from TCT to get the job done (union contracts require that work is done internally)
- very few signs direct people onto the trail (per Marc), and many rural sections lack signs which indicate that you are even on a section of the TCT (per Lea, and as we discovered 1st hand in Zealand NB)
- when gov't partners are aligned things work: 
	- PEI owns and manages the whole Confederation Trail (a 470km segment of the TCT) and far exceeds guidelines for signage, and sees the TCT essential to its success
	- Montreal currently lacks municipal signage, but Parks Canada is developing a sign system for the Lachine Canal which will include the TCT
- TCT may be somewhat siloized - signage and campaign need to communicate more
- TCT pays for signs (blades) but not posts, poles or bases - maybe this isn't the right approach when dealing with volunteer trail partners? Cole Harbour Parks and Trails indicated a desire to do more, but a lack of resources
- pavilion is a large scale liability - little new funding will brought in via the program from now on, but pavilions are expensive to build and maintain. Nevertheless, donor expectations may make it hard to remove or modify the program to better suit current fundraising goals. 
- use-limiting signage (e.g. "no ATVs") are paid for by trail partners
- liability can be ambiguous WRT trail sharing
	- $10M insurance must be purchased by trail partners, but there is no way to check on this on a regular basis
	- trail partners are supposed to list the TCT on insurance policies, but again, difficult to check on this
- TCT branding is often missing altogether in municipalities
- new TCT logo lacks visibility when compared to other signs
- general lack of signage pointing out amenities and sights (e.g. washrooms, local museums or lookoffs)
- old interpretive signs are out of date, and are aging badly
- no national interpretive programming currently
	- what topics should be left to trail partners? 
		- local culture or history
	- what topics should be covered by TCT?
		- telling the Trans Canada Trail story should be first priority
		- national culture or history
	- do we ensure that interpretive panels fulfull some standard?
		
- current (new) signs are largely untested; they have been in place for only about a year in some spots. Longevity is unknown. 
- integration of TCT signs or symbols with other groups signs is poor
- branding itself is weak: how to make the TCT prestigious like the Camino or other traditional European long-distance trails?
- vastly different experiences with various trail partners, which need different handling: 
	1. municipal organizations with vast labour and $ resources, but limited in commitment to supporting a connected national trail (Calgary)
	2. gov't organizations with vast labour and $ resources, with strong commitment to national trail (PEI, North Vancouver)
	3. volunteer organizations who understand the with committed members and some labour resources, lacking $ and land (Cole Harbour Parks and Trails Assoc.)
